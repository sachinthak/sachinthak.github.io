My name is Sachintha Karunaratne and I'm an Engineer by training, a Data Scientist by trade, and an ambitious life-long learner by birth.
Currently, I'm employed as a Data Science Lead in the Advanced Analytics team at [Coles Supermarkets](https://www.coles.com.au), Australia. I graduated with a BSc. Honours degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk), Sri Lanka in 2008 and obtained a PhD in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), Australia in 2015. My professional interests are in Bayesian Inference, Monte Carlo methods, Causal inference, Econometrics, and Simulations. My other interests, which are too many to exhaustively list here, include learning to play the Piano, Classical Guitar, and [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachintha).

The main purpose of this blog is to document and share various Data Science experiments that I occasionally do to (a) up-skill myself and (b) to apply the skills/knowledge that I have already acquired. I hope that having a blog would also motivate me to be actively engaged in the field.
